Store
=====

Store is a software application designed to help you efficiently manage the products of a store or establishment. It includes secure access with a unique user account for using the software. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for user needs while maintaining a user-friendly interface that allows for future feature enhancements and the development of soft skills to improve the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Store is developed using Java, ensuring platform independence and suitability for various environments.

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: The project is designed to work seamlessly with your preferred Java IDE, providing a powerful development environment.

## Methodology

We follow a structured development methodology for the creation of Store, ensuring a systematic approach to building the software.

### Stage 1: Definition of Requirements

In this initial stage, we clearly identify and document all the requirements and objectives of the project. This includes defining the main features of the software, the services it will offer, and the needs of our users.

### Stage 2: Design

Once the requirements are established, we move to the design phase. Here, we create a detailed software design that includes the software architecture, user interface, main functionalities, and any integration with external systems.

### Stage 3: Implementation

With the complete design in place, the software development begins. This phase involves the creation of the necessary technological infrastructure, coding of the functionalities, and integration of system components.

### Stage 4: Testing

After implementation, we conduct thorough testing to ensure that the software works as intended. This includes functionality, performance, and usability testing.

### Stage 5: Deployment

Once the tests are satisfactory, and the software is ready for use, we proceed with deployment, which involves making the software accessible to users.

### Stage 6: Operation and Maintenance

Once the software is operational, we establish an ongoing operation and maintenance process. This includes server administration, performance monitoring, bug fixes, and implementation of improvements.

### Stage 7: Evaluation and Feedback

As Store is used, we collect feedback from users and evaluate their experiences to continuously enhance the software.
